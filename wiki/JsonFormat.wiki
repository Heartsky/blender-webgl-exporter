#summary Describes in detail the JSON data exported by this plugin.

= Introduction =

The JSON exporter is mainly intended to be used on multi-platform scenarios where not only WebGL is used, but also OpenGL ES in embedded platforms like Android, iOS, BB OS, Symbian, WebOS, etc.


*WARNING*: This specification is changed almost monthly, mostly because of a work in progress of the associated 3D engine.

= Details =

This format stresses minification of the JSON output, so it isn't very human readable. Use any JSON viewer to understand its organization.
